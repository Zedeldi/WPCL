A small userspace program to get a USB Wireless PC Lock working on GNU/Linux.

## Context

I picked up this little 'Wireless PC Lock' from a charity shop, for about Â£2. While it seemed like a pretty neat concept all those years ago, much better implementations for remote locking exist now, e.g. Bluetooth proximity, NFC, etc. As it was just lying around, I figured I'd try to put something together to make it more useful.

For reference, a review can be found here: <https://www.dansdata.com/pclock.htm>

### Receiver

- USB ID: 13b7:7417
- Reportedly 315MHz (US), 434MHz (everywhere else)

 ![Receiver](images/receiver.png?raw=true)

- Uses generic HID drivers; recognised as a joystick

### Software

- Originally designed for Windows 98 to XP
- Ugly & flawed, didn't use Windows' API for screen locking
- Featured poorly-written error messages

## Installation

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Zedeldi/WPCL.git`
2. Install required Python modules: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python3 WirelessPCLock.py`

## Configuration

Within utils.py, modify `lock()`, `unlock()`, and `getLockState()` to match your requirements. By default, it uses [i3lock](https://github.com/i3/i3lock) as the screen-locker.

## How it Works

Plainly, it checks for input from the receiver, and locks the screen accordingly; if data is waiting, the transmitter is in range and `unlock()` is executed. After each event, the device buffer is flushed, and the program waits for more input. If a timeout is reached instead, `lock()` is called.

Libraries:

- [evdev](https://pypi.org/project/evdev/) - device event interface
- [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) - check running processes
- [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/) (GTK) - graphical tray applet

A very simplified bash version, which just watches for input from a character device:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
	if `timeout 3 cat "/dev/input/by-id/usb-13b7_7417-event-joystick" | read -n 1`; then
		echo "Data received"
	else
		echo "Timed out"
	fi
done
```

## Caveats

As the receiver is recognised as a joystick, we have no interface to deal with RF stuff; we would need a specific driver for that. Therefore, there is no way - as far as I can tell - to differentiate between transmitters, unless the receiver emits different 'joystick events', depending on what it hears. Unfortunately, I have no other RF devices to test this.
